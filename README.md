**Goals / Why?**

- Removed all `private` ips
- Removed all `old/deprecated` blocklists
- Proper `TTL to avoid spamming` https://iplists.firehol.org
- `Fix inconsistencies` between .netset (contains subnets) and .ipset (contain
  single ips)
- git is a much `more efficient protocol` for fetching text files
- Be able to make `statical analysis` and `prevent false positives`
- Detect which `blocklists are lagging behind`
- Because it's `fun`
