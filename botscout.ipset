# [BotScout] (http://botscout.com/) helps prevent automated 
# web scripts, known as bots, from registering on forums, 
# polluting databases, spreading spam, and abusing forms on 
# web sites. They do this by tracking the names, IPs, and 
# email addresses that bots use and logging them as unique 
# signatures for future reference. They also provide a simple 
# yet powerful API that you can use to test forms when 
# they're submitted on your site. This list is composed of 
# the most recently-caught bots.
